export const HERO_CONTENT = `Hello, my name is Araju Sharma. I'm a recent grad at University of Colorado Boulder with a major in Computer Science and minor in Creative Tech and Design. I'm passionate about learning full stack development focused on creating scalable and high performance projects. With 3 years of personal hands-on experience, I specialize in front-end technologies such as HTML5, CSS, React, Next.js, Express.js, and TailwindCSS as well as back-end technologies such as Node.js, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. I also have experience working with Prisma, Firebase, Cloudinary, and Zustand. The projects I have worked on also include real time features using Socket.io and dynamic UIs using Framer Motion.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `My web development journey started with a curiosity for technology when I was very young playing around with inspect elements in Nepal. This passion grew when I moved to the U.S. and began pursuing my computer science degree at University of Colorado Boulder. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy tackling complex challenges to come up with high quality solutions. Outside of coding, I stay active through hiking, snowboarding, and roadtripping, and Iâ€™m passionate about contributing to open source projects whenever I can. I also like to paint and watch animes as a hobby!`;
